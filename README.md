# Image Processing and Computer Vision (IPCV)

This is the work done for the **Image Processing ad Computer Vision (IPCV)** exam of the *Artificial Intelligence Master's Degree* at the University of Bologna:

- `assignment1` is about *Object Detection* using the **OpenCV library**, with both single and multiple instance detection;
- `assignment2` is about training a Neural Network for *Image Classification*, with a first part where a VGG-inspired NN has been designed for the specific task and dataset and a second part that refers to the usage of ResNet-18 with fine-tuning tecniques.
